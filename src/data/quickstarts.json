A minion is a containerized application that receives and manages jobs set up through the Synthetics UI. For details see our [Private locations overview](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations).\n\n### New Relic Synthetics Containerized Private Minion\n\nThe Containerized Private Minion (CPM) runs on your private network to monitor internal endpoints not accessible from the Internet. Each CPM is configured to process jobs for a specific private location identified by the private location key. For CPM installation instructions see [Install containerized private minions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-containerized-private-minions-cpms).\n\n### Why should you monitor your private locations and CPMs?\n\nMonitoring private locations is critical to knowing when the CPM might be struggling to process jobs. Some common issues include:\n\n- DNS/firewall/proxy blocking connections on your local network\n- overloaded CPM\n- mis-configured CPM\n- under-provisioned host\n- internal engine errors.\n\nIf the CPM fails to process jobs in a timely manner, it can lead to gaps in reported results, false positive alerts, or delayed results.\n\nDownload and install the New Relic Synthetics Private Locations quickstart today to be informed about the health of your private locations and CPMs.",

It enables platform operators to quickly deploy a fully managed, secure-by-default service mesh, helping developers discover and securely connect any application on any runtime, including Kubernetes, Nomad, and Amazon ECS.\n\n### Monitor HCP Consul metrics with New Relic\nKeeping your Consul and Nomad clusters healthy can help with optimizing SQL query times, troubleshooting slow HTTP response times, and real-time alerting on down-time for your Hashicorp clusters. Monitoring your Hashicorp cluster metrics is pivotal for keeping your Hashicorp mesh services operating at full capacity.\n\nNew Relic supports monitoring of HCP Consul and Envoy metrics through the StatsD plugin integration. The StatsD plugin aggregates all the metrics exposed by HCP Consul and pushes them to New Relic for data visualization and alerting.\n\n### HCP Consul quickstart highlights\nThe HCP Consul quickstart for New Relic provides a pre-made dashboard with HCP Consul and Envoy metrics to get started easily. This dashboard provides visibility into the health of your HCP Consul environment with 6 tabs:\n\n- Overview: key indicators describing the overall health of your HCP Consul environment\n- Client: Insight into the health of your client members, such as API HTTP calls, cache, nodes, and messages\n- Network: Indicators on network health including metrics for RPC, TCP, UDP, and gRCP\n- Runtime: Node runtime health metrics for garbage collection, heap size and allocation, and Go routines\n- Serf: Node discover and orchestration\n- Envoy: Proxy health, cluster membership health, and network traffic performance",

    "description": "## Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for Snowflake\nMonitor your Snowflake application with our Infra agent in a complex environment and stay on top of performance issues.\n\n## Why monitor Snowflake?\nThe performance monitoring tool for Snowflake helps you monitor the entire infrastructure and identifies the critical issues in your Snowflake application. Snowflake performance monitoring enables you to get a complete overview of Snowflake errors and know when and where your Snowflake application slows down. Some key components are:\n\n- Monitor  Snowflake applications can be used to create rich and varied user interfaces running within a browser by using Infra agent.\n- Help you identify issues that are truly important and quickly resolve them. Gain knowledge of performance issues in advance and thus giving you ample time to avoid application downtime.\n- Scalable error monitoring without affecting production flow. \n- Maintain a low latency and fast throughput. \n- View the overall health of your production environment in order to quickly identify and resolve problems with crippled services.\n- Performance provides you with the information you need to not only prioritize critical performance issues, but also trace them down to the root cause and solve them more quickly.\n- Monitor your warehouse performance of Snowflake.\n\n## What’s included in this quickstart?\nWith our  Snowflake quickstart, you get:\n\n- Alerts (Disk Spillage, Queries being queued, Failed Queries).\n- Dashboards (credit usage, query performance, longest queries etc).\n- Monitor Queries executed.\n- Monitor warehouse performance.\n- Optimize costs-whether that’s expensive queries, users running many queries, or warehouses that contribute the most to your bill.\n- Detect potential security issues and failed logins.\n- Monitor and alert on custom Snowflake data.",

It includes several data structures which make it ready to use right out of the box.\n\nNew Relic provides a Redis quickstart which allows you to monitor your Redis instances out-of-the-box.\n\n### New Relic - a perfect tool to monitor Redis using Prometheus.\n\nRedis is known for its speed, so ensuring that it stays operating at peak performance is paramount. Slowdowns can lead to a compromised user experience or even a complete application failure.\n\nUsing the [New Relic Prometheus Remote-Write](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/set-your-prometheus-remote-write-integration/) integration you can deliver your critical Redis metrics from your internally supported instance of Prometheus directly to New Relic where the rest of your observability data resides.\n\n### New Relic Redis quickstart features\n\nOur Redis quickstart include out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts, including data such as:\n- Overview Snapshot (# masters, # slaves) + charts with commands/sec and commands/sec by node\n- Charts showing connected clients, connected clients by node, changes since last save by node, expired keys/second by node, memory used by node, and blocked clients.\n- Charts showing keyspace hit ratio by node, evicted keys/second by node, input bytes/second by node, network I/O per second, and output bytes / second by node.\n- This quickstart is based on metrics sent to New Relic using Prometheus Agent or Prometheus Server.\n\n### Value of the Redis (Prometheus) quickstart\n\nThe Redis (Prometheus) Quickstart provides a visual snapshot of all the key health information related to your Redis nodes and clusters. Monitoring is made easy via the clear, color-coded dashboard which showcases memory usage, network I/O, node health, and much more.\n\n### Redis Prometheus Exporter (Kubernetes)\n\nIf you are supporting Redis and Prometheus in a Kubernetes cluster, you can easily export Redis metrics to Prometheus using the [Prometheus Redis Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus-redis-exporter).",

    "description": "## Varnish Cache and why should you monitor it?\n\nVarnish is a web cache used for content delivery and website acceleration. Media delivery over the internet can often experience lags and slow downs related to heavy user traffic and high throughput volumes. Varnish helps to address these issues by offering CDNs, streaming servers, caches, and HTTP/API reverse proxies that speed up the user experience. Caches such as Varnish are sensitive to things like insertion hits and misses and backend interactions, so it’s important to monitor such metrics to ensure Varnish runs smoothly.\n\n### New Relic Varnish quickstart highlights\n\nThe New Relic Varnish quickstart provides a number of visual dashboards that display real-time insights into Varnish cache performance. These include:\n- Session connections and drops\n- Expired objects\n- Requests\n- Cache hits\n- Cache misses\n- Cache hits for misses and passes\n- Cache grace hits\n- And many more…\n\n### New Relic - The complete Varnish dashboard tool\n\n[New Relic enables cohesive Varnish monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/varnish-cache-monitoring-integration/). Varnish’s value is its ability to enhance the speed of backend requests and content serving; however, such value is negated by any performance issues that Varnish experiences. Having real-time insight into key Varnish metrics provided by New Relic is essential to keeping it running at peak capacity.\n\nDashboards, such as the ones on cache hits and misses, can help. Cache hits refer to successful requests to items in the Varnish cache. Conversely, cache misses are those requests which hit an empty cache and thus need to fetch data from the origin. Ideally, one should look to maximize cache hit rate, calculated as # of cache hits / total requests, and a hit rate of 95% or higher should be achievable. These two dashboards let you calculate this.",

Every minute, the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where you can monitor your website’s performance.\n\n### New Relic + WebSphere Liberty Profile = Optimum performance monitoring\n\nOur WebSphere Liberty Profile quickstart empowers you to [configure New Relic’s Java agent for your WebSphere Liberty Profile](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/additional-installation/ibm-websphere-application-server/). With a configuration customized for your application, you can monitor browser performance and WebSphere PMI metrics like memory, threads, and HTTP sessions.\n\nNew Relic supports all versions of WebSphere and IBM Java Virtual Machine that are compatible with the Java agent. (If you’re using Java 2 Security with WebSphere, you need to grant the Java agent additional permissions for proper execution).\n\nYou can also configure the Java agent to capture any WebSphere PMI metrics you want. Such metrics will be displayed on the New Relic JVM metrics page. These metrics will be listed under different tabs like memory, thread, HTTP sessions, and data sources.\n\nThe memory tab has heap memory usage, garbage collection and class count. The thread tab has thread count and thread pool. The HTTP sessions tab shows the active, invalidated by timeout, and invalidated HTTP session counts of your application. The data sources tab will show you metrics like wait time, max connections, active connections, and idle connections.\n\nInstall the New Relic WebSphere Liberty Profile quickstart to effectively monitor Liberty Profile key performance indicators with our Java agent.

    "description": "## Monitoring Psycopg2\n\nPsycopg2 is a popular PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. It is an API which allows Python to interface with Postgres databases. It has a number of features such as thread safety, and was designed with concurrency in mind(supporting large numbers of simultaneous operations to a single database).\n\nWhile thread safety protects against common parallel programming errors, there are still things that can go wrong. Parallel connections increase memory and CPU utilization and can cause difficult-to-catch bugs. The Psycopg2 quickstart automatically monitors your Psycopg2 instances and provides instantaneous feedback on key metrics that affect performance.\n\n### New Relic Psycopg2 quickstart features\n\nThe Quickstart offers a number of visual dashboards that display the following data:\n- CPU Utilization\n- Memory heap used \n- Garbage collection CPU time\n- Top 5 slowest transactions\n- Throughput reports\n- Most popular transactions\n- And more…\n\nIt also offers alerts which will notify you when any of the metrics you’re monitoring fall into a critical range, or if an error arises. Alerts include\n- Apdex score\n- CPU utilization\n- Transaction error\n\n### New Relic - The complete Psycopg2 dashboard tool\n\nAny [Python application](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-python/) which interfaces with a Postgres database is likely to use Psycopg2. This spans a huge array of applications from web backends to machine learning tools to general data stores. Regardless of the specific application, working with Psycopg2 on large-scale projects requires instantiating multiple simultaneous connections with the database. When this many connections are active at once, applications running Psycopg2 become prone to slowdowns or failure. \n\nThis observability pack can help you detect those before they become an issue. For example, the New Relic dashboards and alerts relating to CPU utilization provide notifications when a CPU running Psycopg2 nears full capacity. This can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify which sections of an application might need refinements or refactoring.\n\nAnother great tool are the alerts on transaction errors. This alert quick catches errors related to database transactions before they derail the rest of an application. They also speed up the debugging process as visibility into the sources of errors.",

It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript (i.e. JavaScript plus additional features). The language is primarily designed to empower developers to build large apps and transpiles to JavaScript.\n\n### Common uses of TypeScript\n\nOftentimes, developers using JavaScript complain about the absence of strong static characters, TypeScript perfectly addressed this challenge. Among many other things, developers can leverage TypeScript for the following:\n- Build large-scale applications and transform their source code into JavaScript.\n- Use IntelliSense which actively provides hints as code is added.\n- Specify the types of data passed within the code, and report errors if types don't match.\n\n\n### What’s included in this quickstart?\n\nMontoring TypeScript is critical to help you access logs and identify errors in your application. With New Relic monitoring quickstart, you will get a scalable monitoring package that empowers you to identify performance issues before they happen. By monitoring TypeScript, you will achieve a seamless production flow while maintaining low latency with fast throughput.\n\n### Get these TypeScript monitoring features out of the box with our quickstart:\n- Understand the health of your with: throughput and error rate data, logs, web transaction time, Apdex score, and more apdex score and more).\n- Correlate TypeScript application metrics with your server’s primary health metrics, like CPU usage, memory, network usage, and disk space.\n- Create high-value baseline alerts that proactively inform developers about the status of their apps.",

    "description": "## Why monitor Netty?\nNetty is a tool for building performant, low-level network servers and clients in Java. It operates on an asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model, meaning that it can serve or receive multiple requests simultaneously while maintaining running background processes. \n\nWhile Netty is powerful and runs with lower resource usage than its blocking counterparts, its non-blocking paradigm makes the code it creates harder to test and more difficult to read. The fact that it operates at a low level close to the hardware makes it prone to difficult-to-debug errors. Thus, actively monitoring each Netty instance is vital to keeping all the servers and clients on which it is based running smoothly. The Netty quickstart provides dashboards and alerts that enable continuous monitoring of Netty application health.\n\n### New Relic Netty quickstart features\n\nThe Netty quickstart contains a number of helpful dashboards and alerts that monitor your Netty performance. These include\n\n#### Dashboards  \n- Transactions overview provides information about average transaction duration, slowest 10% duration transactions, total transactions, and success rates.\n- The errors overview gives insight into total transactions and failed transactions by both percentages and total numbers.\n- The VM overview lets you introspect average CPU utilization, average physical memory usage, and total average memory used.\n- The top 10 failed transactions dashboard shows failed transactions with the greatest impact.\n- The latest error dashboard gives insights into recent errors.\n- And more.\n\n#### Alerts\n- The CPU utilization alert is triggered at 90% usage.\n- The high memory usage alert is triggered at 90% usage\n- The low APDEX score alert is triggered when it falls below 0.5 for 5 mins.\n- The transaction error alert is triggered by >10% transaction failure rate over 10 mins.\n\n### New Relic - The Complete Netty Dashboard Tool\n\nMonitor your Netty application to ensure its success and stability. Servers often experience high loads, where hundreds of thousands, even millions, of requests can hit them simultaneously. The New Relic Netty dashboard empowers developers and system admins to stay on top of Netty’s performance and address any critical issues that arise.\nHaving insight into Netty, the state of Netty transactions, and associations such as the Apdex score, are important for ensuring a client is acceptably handling the majority of inbound and outbound requests. If requests begin failing, and the Apdex score dips significantly, this could be an indicator that something is going wrong in the system - perhaps there’s a concurrency issue, a need to scale up the server’s resources, a backend bug, or something else. The New Relic Netty quickstart allows these errors to be flagged with alerts and then drilled down into using the metrics provided in the dashboards. Specifically, the quickstart automatically sets up dashboards with meaningful metrics and default alert notifications for common Netty issues.\n\nThe Netty dashboards provide users tools to monitor global Java VM health, so that if there’s another Java application dragging the system down, it can be identified and addressed before a Netty server, client, or network protocol crashes.",

Utilities like mongostat and mongotop offer immediate results but fail to provide insights into trends in a highly graphical visual dashboard. MongoDB dashboards provide insights into key metrics like RAM usage, operations per second, page fault, disk size, lock %, and app and database performance at a glance. \n\nAvoid slow queries with  proper indexes that impact performance. Instantly monitor your entire MongoDB database with our instant observability kit or the MongoDB free monitoring tool.  \n\nThe critical differences between MongoDB free monitoring and monitoring MongoDB with New Relic’s instant observability quickstart are efficiency, usability, scope, and cost. MongoDB free monitoring focuses on standalone instances and replica sets. Data collected on disk utilization, memory, and operation execution times are uploaded periodically. \n\n\n### What’s Included?\n\nNew Relic + MongoDB quickstart - New Relic’s instant observability quickstart provides multiple monitoring parameters like operations per second, transactions, and queries by default (with Nagios, you must configure each parameter).\n\nNew Relic’s MongoDB quickstart contains multiple dashboards, including:\n- Total Commands, failed commands per second, bytes in & out per second, available connections, and more. \n\nMonitor MongoDB with New Relic to quickly gain improved distribution and increased visibility into real-time user and app response times, throughput and breakdown by component and layer, and long-term data trends over time.  \n\n### Value of MongoDB Quickstarts\n\n[MongoDB performance monitoring with New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mongodb-monitoring-integration/) offers advanced features, including:\n- Obtain app performance insights (without logging in to DB instances).\n- Create custom queries and charts of your data integrations.\n- Filter and analyze configuration data and metrics in Infrastructure UI.\n\nNew Relic’s instant observability quickstart helps developers reduce administrative overheads and accelerate time to value. As New Relic is SaaS-based, you also don’t have to worry about maintenance or onboarding.",

The New Relic Kubernetes monitoring quickstart gives you visibility into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads in minutes, whether your clusters are hosted on-premises or in the cloud.\n\n### Kubernetes quickstart highlights\n\nThe New Relic Kubernetes quickstart uses dashboards to proactively monitor your metrics, like:\n\n- resources used\n- number of K8s objects\n- namespaces per cluster\n- pods by namespace\n- container cpu usage\n- container restarts\n- missing pods by deployment\n- node resource consumption, and more.\n\nThis quickstart is also compatible with on-host integrations like:\n\n- Cassandra\n- MySQL\n- Apache, and more.\n\n### New Relic + Kubernetes = Optimum performance monitoring\n\nThe [New Relic Kubernetes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/) quickstart has multiple components that work together to give you end-to-end observability across your clusters. While you have the flexibility to deploy the components that you prefer, to achieve full observability, you need to install the complete package to monitor all metrics. Use our quickstart to generate a Kubernetes manifest and add Pixie for more fine-grained telemetry data. You can also do the installation with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data.\nOur quickstart monitors the aggregated core and memory usage across all nodes in your cluster. This allows you to meet resource requirements for optimal application performance. It also empowers you to track resource consumption, find pods that aren't running, monitor disk usage, and troubleshoot container restarts. The New Relic Kubernetes integration has dashboards and a cluster explorer that provide a multi-dimensional representation of a Kubernetes cluster from which you can explore your namespaces, deployments, nodes, pods, containers, and applications. Download the New Relic Kubernetes quickstart today to gain instant visibility into your Kubernetes services, clusters and workloads in minutes.",

    "description": "## NService Bus\n\nNServiceBus is a messaging system for service-oriented backend architectures. It is specifically designed for [.NET applications](https://newrelic.com/products/application-monitoring/NET), and it implements a Pub/Sub brokering system, along with many other features, that make handling service messaging simple and intuitive. However, backend architectures are complicated, with many interacting services and processes, so it is not unusual for messages to get dropped or corrupted in some way. \n\nThe New Relic complete monitoring quickstart provides insight into all aspects of the NServiceBus application runtime, saving users from countless headaches that could arise when working with the system.\n\n### New Relic NServiceBus quickstart features\n\nThe New Relic NServiceBus Quickstart comes packaged with numerous features that ensure the health of the NServiceBus application. They are broken down into two categories. \nDashboards, which provide visual insight into application performance, and Alerts, which notify developers when a potential issue arises within NServiceBus.\n\nDashboards include the following \n- Transactions overview which gives an overview of all messaging transactions passing through NServiceBus\n- Errors overview documenting errors occurring within the system and their potential origins\n- VM overview which reports key VM utilization statistics such as memory and CPU usage\n- Top 10 failed transactions shares the highest impact failed transactions which are causing a backend to lag\n- Latest error report has the most recent error so that it can be immediately addressed\n- And more…\n\nAlerts include\n- Apdex score updates you when the apdex score, i.e. the ratio of satisfied/successful requests to total requests, falls below a certain threshold\n- Memory usage sends an alert when RAM usage exceeds a pre-set threshold\n- Transactions error alerts the user when transaction errors climb past a certain level\n\n### New Relic - the ideal NServiceBus monitoring tool\n\nNew Relic’s quickstart provides the ultimate in NServiceBus monitoring solutions. Having continual insight into NServiceBus performance is key to ensuring that backend systems run smoothly with consistent uptime, as messaging is a huge point of failure for backend architectures. When messages are not transacted successfully, communication between backend services breaks down leaving the application unable to function successfully as a whole. \n\nBy providing dashboard insight into the apdex score and commonly failed transactions, and alerts which notify the user prior to reaching critical thresholds, the New Relic quickstart allows weak points in the system to be identified immediately, before communication in the backend fails completely. \n\nSimilarly, proper management of the NServiceBus VM is critical to ensuring that the NServiceBus application itself doesn’t crash completely. The New Relic dashboards and alerts provide continual VM monitoring, allowing developers to make key decisions regarding throttling and other performance constraints when usage gets too high.",

    "description": "## Why monitoring Java is so important\n\nJava is a compiled language, with the potential to be very fast. However, there are a a lot of Java-specific quirks that make the average program slow such as high default memory usage and lags in the startup time of the JVM. \n\nIn order to get the most performance out of your Java applications, it’s important to continuously monitor them with tools such as the New Relic Java agent. \n\n### New Relic Java quickstart features\n\n- Dashboards showing average CPU utilization, memory heap used, garbage collection CPU time, top 5 slowest transactions, and more.\n- Alerts for various metrics including high cpu utilization and transaction errors\n\n### New Relic - the perfect Java observability tool\n\n[Proactive Java monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-java/) yields reductions in site latency and improves the user experience. Our Java agent monitors app servers, databases, and message queuing systems, giving insight into all the key components which allow a web app to run. Custom instrumentation is also available for the add-on Java frameworks and libraries which may be used. \n\nThe agent reports metric time-slice and event data, giving insight at scheduled intervals. It also provides JVM-level observability, providing thread pools data, HTTP sessions, and transactions. You can trace request flows through distributed systems, allowing you to pinpoint points of failure and proactively prevent downtime. All metrics and interfaces are unified via an included dashboard which provides a visual display of an application’s performance.\n\nFurther leverage New Relic's APM capabilities by setting up [errors inbox](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/), [transaction tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/introduction-transaction-traces/), and [service maps](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/introduction-service-maps/).",

That’s where New Relic steps in.\n\n### New Relic's Prometheus quickstart\n\nNew Relic offers two Prometheus integration schemes, Remote Write and OpenMetrics. \n\n[Remote Write](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/prometheus-remote-write-integration/) is ideal for well-established Prometheus infrastructures. It provides easy access to your metrics and only takes one line of yaml in your configuration for access. \n\n[OpenMetrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/configure-prometheus-openmetrics-integrations/) allows for more visibility across multiple container platforms. Once the integration is set up, you can query data on memory usage for pods in deployment, facet any metrics, and view raw metric values all in one place.\n\nNew Relic's Prometheus Integration stores various kinds of telemetry data - whether open-source, vendor-specific, or vendor-agnostic. \n\n### Value of the Prometheus quickstart \n\nNew Relic’s quickstart makes DevOps easier. Although there are many ways to use Prometheus data in New Relic, we’ll break these down into OpenMetrics and Remote Write to help you decide on the best option for you:\n\n#### OpenMetrics:\n\n- Use pre-built dashboards to monitor Kubernetes HPA capacity, or build your own!\n- Monitor node readiness, and create alerts to let you know if a node is having issues and should not accept workloads\n- Automatically instrument and monitor any OpenMetrics endpoint. \n\n#### Remote Write:\n\nSee all of your metrics in one place\n- Combine and group all data across an entire software stack\n- Connect Grafana dashboards\n- Better understand the relationship between data and behaviors related to your software stack",

Track key transactions, monitor a dashboard for critical metrics, and trigger alerts whenever an error or problem is detected before it impacts users.\n\nThe Python quickstart enables development teams to dive deep into performance metrics to inspect database query traces, code-level transaction traces, and error traces.\n\n### Why monitoring Python is so important\n\nPython monitoring agents enable developers to troubleshoot application and endpoint issues, identify specific dependencies, and meet service level agreements. \n\nDevelopment teams can view detailed stack traces of sampled threads and extend performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data in a dashboard. This approach helps teams make data-driven decisions and enhance user experiences.\n\n### What's included in this quickstart?\n\nNew Relic's Python monitoring quickstart boasts instant full-stack observability out-of-the-box:\n- Alerts (Adpex score, CPU utilization, transaction error)\n- Dashboards (most popular transactions, average transaction duration today compared with that for the previous week, Adpex score comparisons, and more) \n- Monitor scripts and functions\n- Monitor WSGI web transactions\n\n### New Relic - complete Python performance monitoring tool\n\nNew Relic's Python agent helps developers measure time-based values like connections per minute. It allows teams to capture discrete events with key-value attributes attached to them and analyze and query data.\n\nIn addition to the above, New Relic's Python agent includes:\n- Browser monitoring\n- Cross application tracing\n- Custom metrics\n- Event loop diagnostics\n- Message queues\n- Runtime metrics\n\nNew Relic's instant observability quickstart helps Python developers minimize complexity and boost efficiency through enhanced visibility.",

Security keys are managed and rotated regularly using  Chef automated cookbooks which allows admins to turn off port access to SSH and WinRM further securing their environments in line with recommendations from industry standards like CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmarks.\n\n# What does New Relic provide\nNew Relic has developed a Chef recipe for the Chef Infra agent to deploy the [New Relic Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/get-started-infrastructure-monitoring/) and [On Host Integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations) throughout your environment.\n\n# How to get started?\nFollow the instructions on New Relic documentation: [Configure the infrastructure agent using Chef](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/config-management-tools/configure-new-relic-infrastructure-using-chef)",

With AWS Health events, you can get visibility into how resource or service changes might affect the apps running on AWS. New Relic AWS Health quickstart empowers you with a [seamless infrastructure integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-health-monitoring-integration/) to report AWS Health event data into New Relic and get instant event visibility.\n\n### New Relic AWS Health integration features\n\nNew Relic AWS Health integration collects information about events that can affect your AWS resources and reports the data to New Relic. AWS Health reports three types of events to New Relic:\n- Open issues: Shows issues that might affect your AWS infrastructure.\n- Scheduled changes: Informs you in advance of scheduled activities that might have an impact on AWS services and resources.\n- Notifications: Provides additional information.\n\n### New Relic + AWS Health for Optimum health performance monitoring\n\nNew Relic AWS Health quickstart automatically instruments AWS Health with our [infrastructure integration](https://newrelic.com/products/infrastructure) to report your AWS data to New Relic. With this, AWS Health events are ingested in New Relic One as AwsHealthNotification events. You can query, create widgets, and define New Relic’s query language (NRQL) alert policies based on these events. NRQL alert conditions can be defined to receive notifications when health events are reported by AWS.\n\nNew Relic helps you to get insights from the event data to anticipate potential application outages. Follow our [standard procedures](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure/) to activate AWS Health integration. Note that the integration is available only for AWS customers who have a Business or Enterprise support plan, because this is a requirement for using the AWS Health API.\n\nNew Relic AWS Health observability quickstart provides you the much-needed event visibility to make troubleshooting faster and more efficient. Download the quickstart today to monitor AWS Health and report its data to New Relic in real-time.",

We aim to turn security into a data problem and replace the frictionful processes for things like breach investigations or achieving compliance standards with simple, contextualized workflows.\nTechnically, our approach is that we replace the traditional 'rules' based mentality that requires you to predict attacker patterns ahead of time with a fully ML based approach.  We baseline what normal user, application and network behaviors look like across your workloads and cloud accounts automatically and then only alert you to deviations from the norm.  This significantly reduces the amount of toil in setting up and maintaining our solution, but also drastically improves the efficacy and amount of security alerts you will receive.\nThe following Quickstart brings the curated security alerts for misconfigurations and anomalous security behaviors into the New Relic platform so you can easily triage against your wealth of observability data or easily transition from monitoring to security investigations from a single interface!\nIf you encounter any issues, have feedback or would like more details on how to get started, please head over to support.lacework.com or send an email to adam.larson@lacework.net!",

So, it’s important to watch executing Node.js systems closely. Monitoring your Node.js applications ensures optimal performance, allows the maximization of system availability, and ensures that a system’s health is well maintained.\n\n### What should you look for in a Node.js dashboard? \n\nA [reliable Node.js network monitor](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-nodejs/) must provide enough information to identify the problem sources. Some crucial information includes process ID, log management, request rate, application availability, resource usage, uptime, downtime, system health, error rates and handling, number of connections, load average, and latency. \n\n### What’s included in the Node.js quickstart?\n\nInstall this quickstart to install preconfigured observability solutions: \n- Multiple high-value alerts, including Apdex score and CPU utilization\n- Informative dashboards (Slowest transactions, throughput comparisons, and more)\n\n### The value of New Relic’s Node.js quickstart\n\nOur tool also provides other essential productivity and efficiency-enhancing innovations. Service Maps acquaints developers with their system's architecture providing vital insights to identify issues quickly. Error Analytics granularly pinpoints offending lines of code, relieving developers of a potentially arduous task so that they can concentrate on resolving issues.

It works by using statistical machine learning on logs and achieves a proven accuracy rate of 95%. This is done without any manual training or rules. When there's a problem, you can now automatically see the root cause directly on any New Relic dashboard.\n\n\n### How to use Zebrium\n\n- Send your logs to Zebrium by installing an open source log collector (Zebrium does not retain your logs, it analyzes them inline). \n- When you know there is a problem, simply look at the Zebrium dashboard and you will see root cause indicators to explain what happened\n\n### Benefits\n\n- For problems that require digging through logs, speed up resolution by 10x\n- Proactively catch problems without requiring any rules\n- Reduce the burden on engineering, SREs and Devops when solving complex incidents\n\n### The Zebrium quickstart includes a dashboard that shows:\n\n- A vertical bar whenever Zebrium detects a potential problem\n- A listing of Zebrium detection summaries that includes an NLP generated summary and a link to the full report in the Zebrium UI\n- Metric charts showing log counts, error counts and anomaly counts\n\nQuestions?

Users may monitor various Delphix objects, such as dSources and VDBs, and trigger alerts on exceeded thresholds. \n\nIn addition, when leveraging the Delphix integration, users can feed data into triggered New Relic workflows to command data-ready RCA environments through a [ServiceNow automated request](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/bb688f9f9734111012b7318c1253af11) or direct webhook.\n\n### What's the value?\n\nThe Delphix Platform is a powerful test data management tool enabling the provisioning of RCA environments for mission-critical applications on demand. The quickstart allows Delphix administrators to monitor their usage, maintain high availability, and reduce the costs of forgotten virtual databases. \n\nSite Reliability Engineers rely on Delphix and New Relic to provide mission-critical application environments within minutes of an issue which eases investigation during stressful issues and helps achieve SLA times. Delphix can reduce provisioning times from days to minutes.\n\n### What's inside?\n\nThe quickstart contains a sample Delphix Platform Dashboard and Storage Utilization Alert to help users get started. \n\nPopulating data for dashboards, alerts, and workflows requires the [Delphix Integration](https://github.com/delphix/dct-newrelic-integration) and [Delphix Data Control Tower](https://docs.delphix.com/dct).",

The integration imports all the labels associated with the containers and helps you to group by the metadata associated with those labels.\n\nOur monitoring quickstart lets you filter down to see all the processes running inside a container using the New Relic “contained” attribute. In addition, you can pinpoint the CPU, memory, and I/O used by any process within a container.\n\n### Why monitor Docker with New Relic?\n\nNew Relic's Docker monitoring quickstart empowers you to get a 360° visibility for your apps, server infrastructure, and Dockerized containers—all in one place. Since your team is likely charged with delivering high-quality software that yields a great customer experience, monitoring Docker is essential. It allows you to keep up that customer experience with your users remaining unaffected by any changes to platforms, tools, languages, or frameworks. \n\nWith our Docker monitoring integration, you can easily identify which container is running which app, and quickly solve any issues.

Between dealing with incoming and outgoing HTTP requests, interfacing with other APIs and backends, the nuances of the server-side code itself, and any sort of distributed interaction or job scheduling, there are many things that can go wrong. When you monitor your Fubumvc instance, it’s much easier to spot these errors before they occur. FubuMVC fails, your whole application will too. New Relic makes it easier to prevent that failure.\nFor example, if you get an  alert when your transaction errors hit a critical a threshold, it can give you advance notice about a dead server, a network bottleneck, or an attack against your web app. Similarly, the CPU utilization dashboard helps you to know when your server load is high and when traffic might be about to overwhelm a particular HTTP service. You can address your issues proactively, before they cause an outage.",

The framework enables the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It takes away the hassle of web development from developers, and empowers them to focus on writing apps without reinventing the wheel.\n\n### New Relic Django quickstart features\n\nThe New Relic Django monitoring quickstart has the following features:\n- Dashboard: Our standard dashboard provides a clear overview of transactions and errors. The dashboards also help you track other key indicators like daily transaction errors, comparison between weekly transaction errors, memory heap used, most popular transactions, and more.\n- Alerts: You can get instant alerts on performance metrics like Apdex score, CPU utilization, and transaction error.\n\n### Why monitor Django with New Relic?\n\nProactively monitor Django with [New Relic’s Python agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-python/). With an interactive dashboard, you can explore, query, and visualize your data. The quickstart also has three alerts that can detect changes in key metrics:\n- The transaction error alert is triggered when transactions fail more than 10% of the time during a 5-minute period.\n- The high CPU utilization alert is triggered when the CPU utilization is above 90%.\n- Similarly, the Apdex score alert is triggered when the Apdex score is below 0.5 during a period of 5 minutes.\n\nIn addition, the New Relic Django integration can automatically add [browser monitoring](https://newrelic.com/products/browser-monitoring) to any HTML page responses for the Django Python web framework. Install the New Relic Django quickstart to instrument Django with New Relic’s Python agent, and track Django’s key metrics in real-time.",

It evaluates your account by using checks which then identify ways to optimize your AWS infrastructure.\n\n\n### New Relic AWS Trusted Advisor quickstart features\n\nThe New Relic AWS Trusted Advisor monitoring quickstart empowers you with our [AWS Trusted Advisor integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-trusted-advisor-integration/) to collect data about key metrics, query the data and gain valuable insights. \n\n### Why monitor AWS Trusted Advisor with New Relic?\n\nNew Relic's integration reports your AWS Trusted Advisor metrics and other data to New Relic. In order to have fresh data, our integration programmatically sends refresh requests to AWS.\n\nYou can activate the integration by following our [standard procedures](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure) for connecting AWS services to New Relic. The monitoring quickstart helps you to track key AWS Trusted Advisor metrics like AWS region, current usage, limit amount, service limit usage, status, and timestamp.\n\nInstall the New Relic AWS Trusted Advisor quickstart today to proactively monitor AWS Trusted Advisor and keep getting quality recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices.",

Observe key metrics like CPU usage, memory, and consumer lag at a glance in a Kafka dashboard. \n\n### Why monitoring kafka is so important\n\nApache Kafka is a fault-tolerant, scalable messaging system used to build real-time data pipelines. Kafka also supports replications natively, and you can build streaming applications that run inside production environments.\n\nLeveraging a Kafka monitoring tool to monitor data replication, retention, and issues like consumer lag is important. New Relic’s Kafka quickstart lets you look at performance metrics and inventory data, create your own custom charts and queries, and create alert policies. \n\n### New Relic Kafka quickstart features\n\n[New Relic’s Kafka monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka-monitoring-integration/) tracks space and time retention, leverages replication alerts to uncover potential issues, and uses queries and a Kafka dashboard to explore them.\n\n### New Relic + Kafka quickstart \n\nNew Relic’s performance monitoring provides instant observability out-of-the-box. This quickstart includes:\n\n- Monitoring Kafka topics\n- Dashboards tracking brokers, messages per sec, broker bytes in and out per sec, consumer lag, and more\n- Monitoring of producers and consumers coded in Java\n\n### New Relic - complete Kafka monitoring\n\nProvide total visibility into key performance metrics like the number of client requests and bytes served per second with New Relic’s Kafka monitoring and also track inventory data and metadata in real-time.\n\nOne of the key features of New Relic’s Kafka monitoring is that you can configure your retention settings by time and by space and set up real-time alerts. \nTrack key metrics like gauge, count, and summary as well with New Relic’s instant observability quickstart. Ensure that your infrastructure remains robust and running while averting potential data loss by monitoring Kafka brokers and Kafka producers.",

The New Relic port monitoring quickstart empowers you to monitor the status of networking ports such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).\n\n### Port quickstart highlights\n\nThe New Relic port monitoring quickstart has the following features:\nDashboards: Our dashboards effectively track metrics like total ports open, latest port connected, samples/port, open ports’ timeseries, and open ports by host.\nDetailed installation, configuration, and changelog details in [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-port-monitor).\n\n### New Relic + port = Optimum performance monitoring\n\n[New Relic on-host integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/port-monitoring-integration/) for port monitoring tracks the up and down status of a network port like TCP, UDP, etc. It then reports the data for you to identify issues and solve them quickly. The dashboards provide interactive visualizations to explore your data and understand context. In particular, the dashboard offers you the ability to drill down into performance details  like the total number of open ports or identify the latest port connected.\nThe port instant observability quickstart provides the necessary insights to make your port troubleshooting easier and more efficient. To use our port monitoring integration, you need to install the [New Relic infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux/). You’ll also need to configure the port-monitor-config.yml.sample file.\nDownload the New Relic port quickstart today to monitor your port’s key performance indicators and address issues efficiently.

It acts as a broker, fielding messages sent from a “producer” application and distributing them to the “consumer” applications for which they are designated. \n\nThe New Relic RabbitMQ agent monitors the performance of RabbitMQ instances, giving insights into their activity. It targets the AMQP RabbitMQ distribution that integrates with Node.js.\n\n### RabbitMQ quickstart highlights\n\nThe New Relic RabbitMQ quickstart automatically instruments your RabbitMQ application, and comes pre-built dashboards visualizing:\n- Total Used File Descriptors by Node\n- Total Memory Usage by Node\n- Consumers by Queue\n- Consumer Message Utilization by Queue\n- Total Messages by Queue\n- Total Message Throughput by Queue\n- Published Messages by Queue\n- Published Messages Throughput by Queue\n\n### New Relic + RabbitMQ - Your tool for better monitoring\n\n[Monitor RabbitMQ](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/rabbitmq-monitoring-integration/) to ensure it’s coordinating messages between producer and consumer apps in a timely and efficient manner. Silent failures are common in RabbitMQ, frequently causing messages to hang or never be delivered. \n\nThis can drastically warp the downstream behavior of an app. By monitoring RabbitMQ application health, system administrators can catch these errors before they occur.\n\nThe key metrics to keep an eye on include memory usage, message throughput and utilization by queue, and queue consumers. Monitoring memory usage allows for detection of system overloads. Similarly, throughput and utilization trade off on queue capacity. \n\nQueues that are underutilized can be identified for message acceptance, and queues with low throughput can be investigated for hanging messages. Finally, insight into queue consumers can help to evenly distribute them across available queues.",

Monitor your app via our dashboard quickstarts and ensure you're delivering the best user experience.\n  \n### Common C# performance errors\nHere are the common C# performance errors that you can handle with New Relic integration:\n- Memory management: C# uses automatic memory management, which takes the burden of manual allocation from developers. However, C# can sometimes run into memory error thereby inhibiting its memory management performance. Our integration offers the best solution to fix that.\n- CPU usage: New Relic’s high CPU utilization alert is the key to monitoring CPU usage to prevent any potential error.\n- Garbage collection: Garbage Collector (GC) manages the allocation and release of memory for your application. When the memory is under distress, our C# integration will easily notify you via the memory usage alert.\n- High volume of requests: Getting a high volume of requests can affect your app’s response time and reduce user satisfaction. With Apdex score, you can track requests and measure user satisfaction.\n- JIT compiler: If JIT compiler fails to load, it may be due to an out-of-memory exception or internal limitation error. The pathway towards getting the insights you need is the New Relic C# integration.\n\n### C# monitoring use cases\n- Focus on the issues that affect your critical business transactions.\n- Gain knowledge on your system's behavior in advance and learn the whole story of performance errors, from beginning to end.\n- Use traces to connect latency issues to errors, getting you to the root cause as quickly as possible.\n- See the filename and line number from the C# stack trace so you never have to guess. To reduce noise, logically filter and aggregate C# exceptions.\n- Scalable error monitoring without affecting production flow.\n- Maintain low latency with fast throughput.\n-  Get meaningful data about C# errors from your dashboard.\n\n## End-to-end visibility into your C# operations\n\nOur C# dashboard translates your ingested data into a map that lets you trace business transactions across your C# stack. See your performance errors in context and prioritize your most critical operations.\n\n## What’s included in this quickstart?\nNew Relic's C# monitoring quickstart boasts instant full-stack observability out-of-the-box:\n\n- Dashboards (Throughput, Error rate, Logs, Web transaction time, Apdex Score and more).\n- Monitor scripts, functions, and web transactions.\n- High-value alerts.\n- Code-related insights about your application’s health and status. \n- Proactive alerts that inform developers about the status of their applications.",

However, in some cases, NGINX may not serve requests as quickly as expected due to problems in an application or architecture. Monitoring NGINX performance is essential to ensure that your web application and server environment are healthy. The key to effective NGINX monitoring is the New Relic NGINX quickstart.\n\n### New Relic Nginx quickstart features\n\n- Dashboards: NGINX dashboards proactively monitor NGINX metrics like requests per second, active connections, connections accepted per second, connections dropped per second, etc.\n- Automatic On-host integrations instrumentation\n- Compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus\n\n### New Relic - the complete Nginx performance monitoring tool\n\n[Monitor key NGINX with the New Relic NGINX Performance monitoring integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/nginx-monitoring-integration/) with metrics like requests per second, connections accepted per second, connections dropped per second, etc. Specifically, our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to the New Relic platform, where you can see valuable insights. From that platform, you can also query data, understand integration data in detail, and create alert conditions.\n\nIn addition, the integration provides useful aggregates of detailed error reports for HTTP error responses. This gives you early warnings of missing pages or code errors and exceptions. With the New Relic NGINX integration, you can monitor NGINX running on an Ubuntu server or running as a service in Kubernetes or on Amazon ECS. The tool is compatible with both the open-source and commercial versions of NGINX.\n\nDownload the New Relic NGINX quickstart today to improve NGINX response time, execute NGINX performance tuning, and monitor NGINX traffic efficiently! It is the key to a healthy NGINX server that provides a seamless user experience for web applications.",

That’s where New Relic steps in.\n\n### New Relic's Prometheus quickstart\n\nNew Relic offers two Prometheus integration schemes, Remote Write and OpenMetrics. \n\n[Remote Write](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/prometheus-remote-write-integration/) is ideal for well-established Prometheus infrastructures. It provides easy access to your metrics and only takes one line of yaml in your configuration for access. \n\n[OpenMetrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/configure-prometheus-openmetrics-integrations/) allows for more visibility across multiple container platforms. Once the integration is set up, you can query data on memory usage for pods in deployment, facet any metrics, and view raw metric values all in one place.\n\nNew Relic's Prometheus Integration stores various kinds of telemetry data - whether open-source, vendor-specific, or vendor-agnostic. \n\n### Value of the Prometheus quickstart \n\nThis New Relic quickstart helps you to configure Prometheus Remote Write.\n\n#### Remote Write:\n\nSee all of your metrics in one place\n- Combine and group all data across an entire software stack\n- Connect Grafana dashboards\n- Better understand the relationship between data and behaviors related to your software stack",

This integration focuses on Query metrics, Transaction metrics, and other DB monitoring metrics, while the infra integration focuses on monitoring the infrastructure.\n\n### About this quickstart\n\nThis integration gives you visibility into key metrics on your Spanner isntance. The metrics included give you deep insights into your Reads, queries, and transactions occuring in your cloud spanner instance.\n\n\n### Key Tips for using this quickstart\n\n- The dashboard included in this quickstart works by using finding `instrumentation.source = gcpspanner.` If you want to use this without changing the queries, be sure to use this as the name to identify the data source from the prometheus link.\n- You can add key identifying variables like project, instance, and database to your dashboard by selecting the `Add variable` option at the top of the dashboard",

    "description": "## What is SNMP?\n\nSimple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a networking protocol used for monitoring managed devices on IP networks. It unlocks insights into any device on your network, physical, or virtual.\n\n### How to monitor SNMP?\n\nNew Relic SNMP integration empowers you to monitor the health of your network. First, you need to poll SNMP data from network devices and send it to New Relic. Then, create a New Relic workload to logically group your devices and set up anomaly detection. Afterward, you can use your new data to understand behaviors within your network.\n\n### Why monitor SNMP with New Relic?\n\nOur SNMP infrastructure monitoring integration helps you to capture critical network performance metrics and inventory reported by SNMP servers.\n\nFollow in the footsteps of DevOps engineers at Synchrony Financial who are leveraging New Relic to monitor their network and other security-related hardware devices like the IBM DataPower gateway. Synchrony Financial runs various threat detection, prevention rules, and policies on the IBM DataPower gateway. However, their IBM DataPower API gateway is a single point of failure through which application traffic is routed. This exposes SNMP metric data about its own availability and performance. By using New Relic SNMP integration, Synchrony DevOps get real-time alerts on any security threats as soon as they are detected.\n\nInstall the New Relic SNMP monitoring quickstart today to proactively monitor the health of your network and correlate network performance with infrastructure, applications, and digital experiences.",

It has a set of object-oriented classes that can be used to connect to a database, provide access to relational data, application data, and XML, and retrieve results.\n\n## Common uses of ADO.net\n\nYou can utilize ADO.net to create reliable and scalable database apps for client- server applications, and work with several data sources. In addition, you can reduce the amount of code and level of maintenance needed for data-oriented applications by using the ADO.NET Entity Framework. \n\nWith ADO.NET DataReader, you can retrieve read-only and forward-only data from a database.\n\n\nDiscovering data access API calls can help your team:\n  - fix inaccessible databases or issues with the network library.\n  - solve your database and client software schema incompatibility.\n  - fix problems that occur when different ADO.NET components interact with one another or your own components.\n  - debug incorrect SQL, whether hard-coded or created by an application. \n  - adjust flawed programming logic.\n\n## What’s included in this quickstart?\n\nThe ADO.NET monitoring quickstart from New Relic provides immediate full-stack observability:\n  - Alerts (high load connection, hard connects exceeding max limit, pool size exceeding optimum limit).\n  - Dashboards (hard connects per second, hard disconnects per second, number of active connections, soft connects per second and more).\n  - Alerts inform end users about the quality of their applications on a proactive basis.\n  - Monitor web transactions.\n  \n  ### Comprehensive monitoring quickstart for ADO.net\n  \n  When you monitor ADO.NET with New Relic, you can observe your ADO.NET data set in real time. Our .NET agent will also let you correlate transactions moving across your application environment and troubleshoot while working in a live development environment.",

    "description": "## What is Azure Virtual Network?\nAzure Virtual Network (VNet) provides the means for Azure cloud resources such as virtual machines to securely communicate with each other as well as the rest of the internet and on-premises resources. Using VNet to create a private network gives you control over network filtering, routing, and other key pieces of the network infrastructure. \nGiven an Azure virtual network, you can do things like assign a public IP, assign a load balancer, and handle outbound connections. VNets are ideal for developers deploying on Azure resources who want fine-grained control over network management.\n\n### New Relic Azure Vnet integration\nNew Relic's integration for Azure Virtual Network reports metric data about your virtual networks (VNets), like packets dropped per second or bytes forwarded per second. It also collects data about the status and configuration of your account. The selection of dashboards include:\n- Total virtual networks: The total number of virtual networks currently live\n- Virtual networks time series: Displays the fluctuation of the total number of virtual networks over a series of timepoints\n- Virtual network per region: Displays the virtual networks within a specific geographic region\n- Public IPs under DDoS attack: Quickly identify which IPs on the network may be experiencing a DDOS attack\n- Virtual network per resource group: Shows the number of virtual networks deployed within each resource group\n\n### Why monitor Azure Virtual Network with New Relic?\nHaving insight into Azure virtual network performance is key to keeping network systems healthy and reliable. Virtual networks are often vulnerable to attack, so continuous monitoring of IP requests and understanding which IPs may be experiencing a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack can be critical for initiating a proactive response. \nThe virtual network time series display can give insight into fluctuations in network health and uptime within a specified interval and can be useful for drilling down into any deviations from the norm.\nFinally, being able to understand how virtual networks are distributed across geographic regions can help you pinpoint when a particular region is being underserved and deploy network resources accordingly.",
