    "description": "## React Native Quickstart\n\nReact Native is a technology which brings the power of the React.js frontend javascript framework to mobile devices.Mobile programming brings with it a unique set of challenges. These devices have sensors such as the touchscreen, accelerometer, and gyroscope that interface with the world and send data back to the application. An effective mobile application must make use of this unique data and also be able to detect and fail gracefully when a sensor fails. \n\nProgramming for mobile devices introduces hardware constraints, so monitoring and managing memory consumption and CPU usage become very important. New Relic provides a React Native Quickstart that allows developers to monitor their mobile applications, giving them full control and peace of mind over their application’s performance.\n\n### New Relic - React Native Quickstart Features\n\n## Get started!\nThe [React Native Quickstart](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2020/10/three-big-updates-your-native-mobile-apps/) provides both visual dashboards and alerts that provide comprehensive React Native monitoring. These include…\n\nDashboards\n- Transaction overview - an overview of all JS transactions initiated and received by React Native\n- Top OS’s - the top mobile OS’s on which users are accessing a React Native app\n- Top 10 transactions - the top 10 app transactions being made at any given time\n- Most popular methods - most popular app methods as decided by user application usage\n- Average interaction duration(s) - average time spent by users interacting with the RN app\n\n Alerts\n - Low APDEX score - alerts the developer when the apdex score falls below a certain threshold\n - Transaction errors - alerts the developer when the number of transaction errors climbs above a certain threshold\n\n### New Relic - Complete React Native Dashboard Tool\n\nThe dashboards and alerts allow developers to extensively optimize their React Native applications and they are the ultimate React Native performance monitor. For example, understanding the Top OS’s allows users to understand which devices are primarily being used to access their applications. While React Native apps are cross-platform, there are still actions that can be taken to optimize for one platform vs. another, i.e. Android vs. Apple or vice versa. The Top OS’s dashboard allows developers to decide how to best enhance OS-specific application performance.\n\nSimilarly, understanding interaction duration can help developers to understand which application features are popular. They can then add or remove features to help increase average interaction duration and improve the app’s popularity or usefulness.\n",

It includes several data structures which make it ready to use right out of the box.\n\nNew Relic provides a Redis quickstart which allows you to monitor your Redis instances out-of-the-box.\n\n### New Relic - a perfect tool to monitor Redis\n\nRedis is known for its speed, so ensuring that it stays operating at peak performance is paramount. Slowdowns can lead to a compromised user experience or even a complete application failure.\n\n[New Relic's Redis monitor](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/redis-monitoring-integration/) provides actionable insights into the health of a Redis system. It supports custom charts, custom queries, and pre-built dashboards are available for those who don’t need custom configurations. All critical performance and health metrics are monitored.\n\n### New Relic Redis quickstart features\n\nOur Redis quickstart include out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts, including data such as:\n- Overview Snapshot (# masters, # slaves) + charts with commands/sec and commands/sec by node\n- Charts showing connected clients, connected clients by node, changes since last save by node, expired keys/second by node, memory used by node, and blocked clients.\n- Charts showing keyspace hit ratio by node, evicted keys/second by node, input bytes/second by node, network I/O per second, and output bytes / second by node.\n\n### Value of the Redis quickstart\n\nThe Redis Quickstart provides a visual snapshot of all the key health information related to your Redis nodes and clusters. Monitoring is made easy via the clear, color-coded dashboard which showcases memory usage, network I/O, node health, and much more.",

    "description": "## Varnish Cache and why should you monitor it?\n\nVarnish is a web cache used for content delivery and website acceleration. Media delivery over the internet can often experience lags and slow downs related to heavy user traffic and high throughput volumes. Varnish helps to address these issues by offering CDNs, streaming servers, caches, and HTTP/API reverse proxies that speed up the user experience. Caches such as Varnish are sensitive to things like insertion hits and misses and backend interactions, so it’s important to monitor such metrics to ensure Varnish runs smoothly.\n\n### New Relic Varnish quickstart highlights\n\nThe New Relic Varnish quickstart provides a number of visual dashboards that display real-time insights into Varnish cache performance. These include:\n- Session connections and drops\n- Expired objects\n- Requests\n- Cache hits\n- Cache misses\n- Cache hits for misses and passes\n- Cache grace hits\n- And many more…\n\n### New Relic - The complete Varnish dashboard tool\n\n[New Relic enables cohesive Varnish monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/varnish-cache-monitoring-integration/). Varnish’s value is its ability to enhance the speed of backend requests and content serving; however, such value is negated by any performance issues that Varnish experiences. Having real-time insight into key Varnish metrics provided by New Relic is essential to keeping it running at peak capacity.\n\nDashboards, such as the ones on cache hits and misses, can help. Cache hits refer to successful requests to items in the Varnish cache. Conversely, cache misses are those requests which hit an empty cache and thus need to fetch data from the origin. Ideally, one should look to maximize cache hit rate, calculated as # of cache hits / total requests, and a hit rate of 95% or higher should be achievable. These two dashboards let you calculate this.",

[DNN Evoq](https://developer.newrelic.com/instant-observability/dnn-evoq/82672f5f-48ec-477c-ae49-7eb24a91595f/) includes customer support and provides premium features not available in the DNN platform. These premium features include personalization, in-page analytics, workflow and built-in connectors to Marketo, SharePoint, Amazon S3, and Dropbox.\n\nIntegrate New Relic .NET agent with your DNN Evoq to monitor the platform’s performance metrics in real time.\n\n### Get started!\n\nLeverage community expertise and instantly get value out of your telemetry data. This quickstart automatically instruments DNN Evoq with the New Relic .Net agent, and allows you to instantly monitor your .Net application with out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts. Further leverage New Relic's APM capabilities by setting up [errors inbox](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/), [transaction tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/introduction-transaction-traces/), and [service maps](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/introduction-service-maps/).\n\n## DNN Evoq and New Relic highlights\n\nNew Relic’s DNN Evoq quickstart instruments DNN Evoq with the [New Relic .NET agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-net/), and empowers you to seamlessly monitor your DNN Evoq platform through out-of-the-box dashboards and alerts.\n\nOur .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core, and it works with all .NET compatible languages. You can track your DNN Evoq platform in dynamic or distributed environments such as on-host VM servers, Microsoft Azure app services, cloud-managed server VM images, self-hosted Windows and Linux systems and Amazon AWS EC2 VMs.\n\n### DNN Evoq ideal performance monitoring\n\nThe DNN Evoq observability quickstart instruments DNN Evoq with New Relic .NET agent. The integration enables you to use [Application Performance Monitoring](https://newrelic.com/products/application-monitoring) (APM) to get a high-level overview of your DNN Evoq platform, and to track activity across the platform. With the integration, you can install [infrastructure monitoring](https://developer.newrelic.com/instant-observability/infrastructure/71419258-a96f-4845-b4f7-723f3b29d6a5/) to view the performance of your platform’s host environment.\n\nOnce you install our .NET agent, wait for a few minutes for your DNN Evoq platform to generate traffic, data will appear in the APM summary page. The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize your installation. You can extend your instrumentation by integrating the .NET agent with [browser monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/new-relic-browser/) to gain visibility into end-user activity. You can also enable distributed tracing to understand activity across your platform.\n\nDownload the New Relic DNN Evoq quickstart to effectively get value out of your telemetry data and monitor your DNN Evoq platform. This quickstart is your gateway to instant monitoring of your platform via our .NET agent.\n",

    "description": "## What is Salesforce Event Log?\n\nSalesforce event log refers to a log file generated when an event occurs in your organization. There are up to 50 event types that can be consumed. Some of the event types include logins, logouts, visualforce page loads, report exports, apex executions, URI (web clicks in Salesforce Classic), application programming interface (API) calls, etc. To collect Salesforce event log data, you have to have read access to the Salesforce event log and enable the Salesforce event log file API. Create a Salesforce 'Connected App' to use OAuth authentication.\n\n### New Relic and Salesforce Event Log\n\nThe New Relic Salesforce Event Log integration allows you to process and forward Salesforce Event Log files to New Relic Logs. Our event monitoring product gathers information about your Salesforce org’s operational events, which you can use to analyze usage trends and user behavior.\n\n### Why monitor Salesforce Event Logs with New Relic?\n\nThe [New Relic Salesforce Event Log](https://newrelic.com/resources/datasheets/salesforce-solution-brief) monitoring quickstart helps you view the granular details of user activities in your organization. With the integration, you can track trends in events, identify suspicious user behavior, and protect your firm’s data. What’s more, you can identify parts of your organization that aren’t performing up to expectation, thereby gaining insights on which performance to optimize.\nTo allow New Relic monitoring products to collect Salesforce Event Log data, you need to have read access to the Salesforce Event Logs, and enable the Salesforce event log file API.\nInstall the New Relic Salesforce Event Log quickstart today to instantly monitor your organization’s Salesforce events in real-time. The instant observability quickstart is the key to a seamless Salesforce Event Log monitoring.",

This gives you insights on client request rates, average pending and active request pool tasks, active and pending read tasks by node, write latency, read latency, etc. \n\nThe Cassandra integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Cassandra database to the New Relic platform. On the platform, you can view pre-built dashboards of your Cassandra metric data, create alert policies, query data for troubleshooting purposes, and create charts.\n\nMonitoring multiple Cassandra servers from the same integration is possible with New Relic by leveraging the multi-instance monitoring configuration. Our integration allows you to monitor Cassandra running as a service in Kubernetes or on Amazon ECS. You can also install New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent on a Linux host that is running Cassandra.\n\nDownload the New Relic Cassandra Quickstart now to monitor Cassandra query performance and improve Cassandra speed.

    "title": "Netty",
    "name": "netty",
    "description": "## Why monitor Netty?\nNetty is a tool for building performant, low-level network servers and clients in Java. It operates on an asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model, meaning that it can serve or receive multiple requests simultaneously while maintaining running background processes. \n\nWhile Netty is powerful and runs with lower resource usage than its blocking counterparts, its non-blocking paradigm makes the code it creates harder to test and more difficult to read. The fact that it operates at a low level close to the hardware makes it prone to difficult-to-debug errors. Thus, actively monitoring each Netty instance is vital to keeping all the servers and clients on which it is based running smoothly. The Netty quickstart provides dashboards and alerts that enable continuous monitoring of Netty application health.\n\n### New Relic Netty quickstart features\n\nThe Netty quickstart contains a number of helpful dashboards and alerts that monitor your Netty performance. These include\n\n#### Dashboards  \n- Transactions overview provides information about average transaction duration, slowest 10% duration transactions, total transactions, and success rates.\n- The errors overview gives insight into total transactions and failed transactions by both percentages and total numbers.\n- The VM overview lets you introspect average CPU utilization, average physical memory usage, and total average memory used.\n- The top 10 failed transactions dashboard shows failed transactions with the greatest impact.\n- The latest error dashboard gives insights into recent errors.\n- And more.\n\n#### Alerts\n- The CPU utilization alert is triggered at 90% usage.\n- The high memory usage alert is triggered at 90% usage\n- The low APDEX score alert is triggered when it falls below 0.5 for 5 mins.\n- The transaction error alert is triggered by >10% transaction failure rate over 10 mins.\n\n### New Relic - The Complete Netty Dashboard Tool\n\nMonitor your Netty application to ensure its success and stability. Servers often experience high loads, where hundreds of thousands, even millions, of requests can hit them simultaneously. The New Relic Netty dashboard empowers developers and system admins to stay on top of Netty’s performance and address any critical issues that arise.\nHaving insight into Netty, the state of Netty transactions, and associations such as the Apdex score, are important for ensuring a client is acceptably handling the majority of inbound and outbound requests. If requests begin failing, and the Apdex score dips significantly, this could be an indicator that something is going wrong in the system - perhaps there’s a concurrency issue, a need to scale up the server’s resources, a backend bug, or something else. The New Relic Netty quickstart allows these errors to be flagged with alerts and then drilled down into using the metrics provided in the dashboards. Specifically, the quickstart automatically sets up dashboards with meaningful metrics and default alert notifications for common Netty issues.\n\nThe Netty dashboards provide users tools to monitor global Java VM health, so that if there’s another Java application dragging the system down, it can be identified and addressed before a Netty server, client, or network protocol crashes.\n",

Every minute, the agent posts metric timeslice and event data to the New Relic user interface, where you can monitor your website’s performance.\n\n### New Relic + WebSphere Liberty Profile = Optimum performance monitoring\n\nOur WebSphere Liberty Profile quickstart empowers you to [configure New Relic’s Java agent for your WebSphere Liberty Profile](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/additional-installation/ibm-websphere-application-server/). With a configuration customized for your application, you can monitor browser performance and WebSphere PMI metrics like memory, threads, and HTTP sessions.\n\nNew Relic supports all versions of WebSphere and IBM Java Virtual Machine that are compatible with the Java agent. (If you’re using Java 2 Security with WebSphere, you need to grant the Java agent additional permissions for proper execution).\n\nYou can also configure the Java agent to capture any WebSphere PMI metrics you want. Such metrics will be displayed on the New Relic JVM metrics page. These metrics will be listed under different tabs like memory, thread, HTTP sessions, and data sources.\n\nThe memory tab has heap memory usage, garbage collection and class count. The thread tab has thread count and thread pool. The HTTP sessions tab shows the active, invalidated by timeout, and invalidated HTTP session counts of your application. The data sources tab will show you metrics like wait time, max connections, active connections, and idle connections.\n\nInstall the New Relic WebSphere Liberty Profile quickstart to effectively monitor Liberty Profile key performance indicators with our Java agent.

    "description": "## Monitoring Psycopg2\n\nPsycopg2 is a popular PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. It is an API which allows Python to interface with Postgres databases. It has a number of features such as thread safety, and it was designed with concurrency in mind(it support large numbers of simultaneous operations to a single database).\n\nWhile thread safety protects against a lot of common parallel programming errors, there are still things that can go wrong. Parallel connections increase memory and CPU utilization and can cause difficult-to-catch bugs. The Psycopg2 quickstart automatically monitors your Psycopg2 instances and provides instantaneous feedback on key metrics that affect performance.\n\n### New Relic Psycopg2 quickstart features\n\nThe Quickstart offers a number of visual dashboards that display the following data:\n- CPU Utilization\n- Memory heap used \n- Garbage collection CPU time\n- Top 5 slowest transactions\n- Throughput reports\n- Most popular transactions\n- And more…\n\nIt also offers alerts which will notify you when any of the metrics you’re monitoring fall into a critical range, or if an error arises. Alerts include\n- Apdex score\n- CPU utilization\n- Transaction error\n\n### New Relic - The complete Psycopg2 dashboard tool\n\nAny [Python application](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-python/) which interfaces with a Postgres database is likely to use Psycopg2. This spans a huge array of applications from web backends to machine learning tools to general data stores. Regardless of the specific application, working with Psycopg2 on large-scale projects requires instantiating tens to hundreds to thousands of simultaneous connections with the database. When this many connections are active at once, applications running Psycopg2 become prone to slowdowns or failure. \n\nFor example, the New Relic dashboards and alerts relating to CPU utilization can provide notifications when a CPU running Psycopg2 nears full capacity. This can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify which sections of an application might need refinements or refactoring.\n\nAnother great tool are the alerts on transaction errors. This alert quick catches errors related to database transactions before they derail the rest of an application. They also make the debugging process much quicker and simpler as visibility into the sources of errors is available immediately. \n",

Individual stages are broken down into tasks and distributed across executor nodes. Our New Relic Spark integration collects detailed job and stage metrics so you can get granular insight into job performance at a glance. For example , break down the Job metric by status (successful, pending, or failed) to see in real-time if a high number of jobs are failing, which could indicate a code error or memory issue at the executor level. Metrics on the number of jobs in realtime can also help you make decisions for provisioning clusters in the future.\n",

However, there are a a lot of Java-specific quirks that make the average program slow such as high default memory usage and lags in the startup time of the JVM. \n\nIn order to get the most performance out of your Java applications, it’s important to continuously monitor them with tools such as the New Relic Java agent. \n\n### New Relic Java quickstart features\n\n- Dashboards showing average CPU utilization, memory heap used, garbage collection CPU time, top 5 slowest transactions, and more.\n- Alerts for various metrics including high cpu utilization and transaction errors\n\n### New Relic - the perfect Java observability tool\n\n[Proactive Java monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-java/) yields reductions in site latency and improves the user experience. Our Java agent monitors app servers, databases, and message queuing systems, giving insight into all the key components which allow a web app to run. Custom instrumentation is also available for the add-on Java frameworks and libraries which may be used. \n\nThe agent reports metric time-slice and event data, giving insight at scheduled intervals. It also provides JVM-level observability, providing thread pools data, HTTP sessions, and transactions. You can trace request flows through distributed systems, allowing you to pinpoint points of failure and proactively prevent downtime. All metrics and interfaces are unified via an included dashboard which provides a visual display of an application’s performance.\n\nFurther leverage New Relic's APM capabilities by setting up [errors inbox](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/), [transaction tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/introduction-transaction-traces/), and [service maps](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/introduction-service-maps/).",

    "description": "## NService Bus\n\nNServiceBus is a messaging system for service-oriented backend architectures. It is specifically designed for [.NET applications](https://newrelic.com/products/application-monitoring/NET), and it implements a Pub/Sub brokering system, along with many other features, that make handling service messaging simple and intuitive. However, backend architectures are complicated, with many interacting services and processes, so it is not unusual for messages to get dropped or corrupted in some way. \n\nThe New Relic complete monitoring quickstart provides insight into all aspects of the NServiceBus application runtime, saving users from countless headaches that could arise when working with the system.\n\n### New Relic NServiceBus quickstart features\n\nThe New Relic NServiceBus Quickstart comes packaged with numerous features that ensure the health of the NServiceBus application. They are broken down into two categories. \nDashboards, which provide visual insight into application performance, and Alerts, which notify developers when a potential issue arises within NServiceBus.\n\nDashboards include the following \n- Transactions overview which gives an overview of all messaging transactions passing through NServiceBus\n- Errors overview documenting errors occurring within the system and their potential origins\n- VM overview which reports key VM utilization statistics such as memory and CPU usage\n- Top 10 failed transactions shares the highest impact failed transactions which are causing a backend to lag\n- Latest error report has the most recent error so that it can be immediately addressed\n- And more…\n\nAlerts include\n- Apdex score updates you when the apdex score, i.e. the ratio of satisfied/successful requests to total requests, falls below a certain threshold\n- Memory usage sends an alert when RAM usage exceeds a pre-set threshold\n- Transactions error alerts the user when transaction errors climb past a certain level\n\n### New Relic - the ideal NServiceBus monitoring tool\n\nNew Relic’s quickstart provides the ultimate in NServiceBus monitoring solutions. Having continual insight into NServiceBus performance is key to ensuring that backend systems run smoothly with consistent uptime, as messaging is a huge point of failure for backend architectures. When messages are not transacted successfully, communication between backend services breaks down leaving the application unable to function successfully as a whole. \n\nBy providing dashboard insight into the apdex score and commonly failed transactions, and alerts which notify the user prior to reaching critical thresholds, the New Relic quickstart allows weak points in the system to be identified immediately, before communication in the backend fails completely. \n\nSimilarly, proper management of the NServiceBus VM is critical to ensuring that the NServiceBus application itself doesn’t crash completely. The New Relic dashboards and alerts provide continual VM monitoring, allowing developers to make key decisions regarding throttling and other performance constraints when usage gets too high.",

The New Relic Kubernetes monitoring quickstart gives you visibility into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads in minutes, whether your clusters are hosted on-premises or in the cloud.\n\n### Kubernetes quickstart highlights\n\nThe New Relic Kubernetes quickstart uses dashboards to proactively monitor your metrics, like:\n\n- resources used\n- number of K8s objects\n- namespaces per cluster\n- pods by namespace\n- container cpu usage\n- container restarts\n- missing pods by deployment\n- node resource consumption, and more.\n\nThis quickstart is also compatible with on-host integrations like:\n\n- Cassandra\n- MySQL\n- Apache, and more.\n\n### New Relic + Kubernetes = Optimum performance monitoring\n\nThe [New Relic Kubernetes](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/) quickstart has multiple components that work together to give you end-to-end observability across your clusters. While you have the flexibility to deploy the components that you prefer, to achieve full observability, you need to install the complete package to monitor all metrics. Use our quickstart to generate a Kubernetes manifest and add Pixie for more fine-grained telemetry data. You can also do the installation with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data.\nOur quickstart monitors the aggregated core and memory usage across all nodes in your cluster. This allows you to meet resource requirements for optimal application performance. It also empowers you to track resource consumption, find pods that aren't running, monitor disk usage, and troubleshoot container restarts. The New Relic Kubernetes integration has dashboards and a cluster explorer that provide a multi-dimensional representation of a Kubernetes cluster from which you can explore your namespaces, deployments, nodes, pods, containers, and applications.

Utilities like mongostat and mongotop offer immediate results but fail to provide insights into trends in a highly graphical visual dashboard. MongoDB dashboards provide insights into key metrics like RAM usage, operations per second, page fault, disk size, lock %, and app and database performance at a glance. \n\nAvoid slow queries with  proper indexes that impact performance. Instantly monitor your entire MongoDB database with our instant observability kit or the MongoDB free monitoring tool.  \n\nThe critical differences between MongoDB free monitoring and monitoring MongoDB with New Relic’s instant observability quickstart are efficiency, usability, scope, and cost. MongoDB free monitoring focuses on standalone instances and replica sets. Data collected on disk utilization, memory, and operation execution times are uploaded periodically. \n\n\n### What’s Included?\n\nNew Relic + MongoDB quickstart - New Relic’s instant observability quickstart provides multiple monitoring parameters like operations per second, transactions, and queries by default (with Nagios, you must configure each parameter).\n\nNew Relic’s MongoDB quickstart contains multiple dashboards, including:\n- Total Commands, failed commands per second, bytes in & out per second, available connections, and more. \n\nMonitor MongoDB with New Relic to quickly gain improved distribution and increased visibility into real-time user and app response times, throughput and breakdown by component and layer, and long-term data trends over time.  \n\n### Value of MongoDB Quickstarts\n\n[MongoDB performance monitoring with New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mongodb-monitoring-integration/) offers advanced features, including:\n- Obtain app performance insights (without logging in to DB instances).\n- Create custom queries and charts of your data integrations.\n- Filter and analyze configuration data and metrics in Infrastructure UI.\n\nNew Relic’s instant observability quickstart helps developers reduce administrative overheads and accelerate time to value. As New Relic is SaaS-based, you also don’t have to worry about maintenance or onboarding.",

OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services.\n\nThe following components make up the OpenTelemetry project:\n\n* Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects. New Relic supports all of these signals: traces, metrics, and logs (see details below)\n* APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more\n* Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting\n* Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice\n\n## How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic\n\nNew Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic.\n\n## Get started!\n\nYou can easily instrument your service with OpenTelemetry and export your telemetry data to New Relic.\nFollow [this OpenTelemetry guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-quick-start/) to get started.\n",

    "description": "## Prometheus monitoring \n\nPrometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. Setting up Prometheus is straightforward, but scaling up and managing is not. That’s where New Relic steps in.\n\n### New Relic's Prometheus quickstart\n\nNew Relic offers two Prometheus integration schemes, Remote Write and OpenMetrics. \n\n[Remote Write](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/prometheus-remote-write-integration/) is ideal for well-established Prometheus infrastructures. It provides easy access to your metrics and only takes one line of yaml in your configuration for access. \n\n[OpenMetrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/configure-prometheus-openmetrics-integrations/) allows for more visibility across multiple container platforms. Once the integration is set up, you can query data on memory usage for pods in deployment, facet any metrics, and view raw metric values all in one place.\n\nNew Relic's Prometheus Integration stores various kinds of telemetry data - whether open-source, vendor-specific, or vendor-agnostic. \n\n### Value of the Prometheus quickstart \n\nNew Relic’s quickstart makes DevOps easier. Although there are many ways to use Prometheus data in New Relic, we’ll break these down into OpenMetrics and Remote Write to help you decide on the best option for you:\n\n#### OpenMetrics:\n\n- Use pre-built dashboards to monitor Kubernetes HPA capacity, or build your own!\n- Monitor node readiness, and create alerts to let you know if a node is having issues and should not accept workloads\n- Automatically instrument and monitor any OpenMetrics endpoint. \n\n#### Remote Write:\n\nSee all of your metrics in one place\n- Combine and group all data across an entire software stack\n- Connect Grafana dashboards\n- Better understand the relationship between data and behaviors related to your software stack\n",

Track key transactions, monitor a dashboard for critical metrics, and trigger alerts whenever an error or problem is detected before it impacts users.\n\nThe Python quickstart enables development teams to dive deep into performance metrics to inspect database query traces, code-level transaction traces, and error traces.\n\n### Why monitoring Python is so important\n\nPython monitoring agents enable developers to troubleshoot application and endpoint issues, identify specific dependencies, and meet service level agreements. \n\nDevelopment teams can view detailed stack traces of sampled threads and extend performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data in a dashboard. This approach helps teams make data-driven decisions and enhance user experiences.\n\n### What's included in this quickstart?\n\nNew Relic's Python monitoring quickstart boasts instant full-stack observability out-of-the-box:\n- Alerts (Adpex score, CPU utilization, transaction error)\n- Dashboards (most popular transactions, average transaction duration today compared with that for the previous week, Adpex score comparisons, and more) \n- Monitor scripts and functions\n- Monitor WSGI web transactions\n\n### New Relic - complete Python performance monitoring tool\n\nNew Relic's Python agent helps developers measure time-based values like connections per minute. It allows teams to capture discrete events with key-value attributes attached to them and analyze and query data.\n\nIn addition to the above, New Relic's Python agent includes:\n- Browser monitoring\n- Cross application tracing\n- Custom metrics\n- Event loop diagnostics\n- Message queues\n- Runtime metrics\n\nNew Relic's instant observability quickstart helps Python developers minimize complexity and boost efficiency through enhanced visibility.\n",

    "description": "## Why monitor AWS Health?\n\nAWS Health gives you regular insights into your resource performance and the availability of your AWS services and accounts. With AWS Health events, you can get visibility into how resource or service changes might affect the apps running on AWS. New Relic AWS Health quickstart empowers you with a [seamless infrastructure integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-health-monitoring-integration/) to report AWS Health event data into New Relic and get instant event visibility.\n\n### New Relic AWS Health integration features\n\nNew Relic AWS Health integration collects information about events that can affect your AWS resources and reports the data to New Relic. AWS Health reports three types of events to New Relic:\n- Open issues: Shows issues that might affect your AWS infrastructure.\n- Scheduled changes: Informs you in advance of scheduled activities that might have an impact on AWS services and resources.\n- Notifications: Provides additional information.\n\n### New Relic + AWS Health for Optimum health performance monitoring\n\nNew Relic AWS Health quickstart automatically instruments AWS Health with our [infrastructure integration](https://newrelic.com/products/infrastructure) to report your AWS data to New Relic. With this, AWS Health events are ingested in New Relic One as AwsHealthNotification events. You can query, create widgets, and define New Relic’s query language (NRQL) alert policies based on these events. NRQL alert conditions can be defined to receive notifications when health events are reported by AWS.\n\nNew Relic helps you to get insights from the event data to anticipate potential application outages. Follow our [standard procedures](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure/) to activate AWS Health integration. Note that the integration is available only for AWS customers who have a Business or Enterprise support plan, because this is a requirement for using the AWS Health API.\n\nNew Relic AWS Health observability quickstart provides you the much-needed event visibility to make troubleshooting faster and more efficient. Download the quickstart today to monitor AWS Health and report its data to New Relic in real-time.",

    "description": "## The comprehensive Node.js monitoring system\n\nNode.js is an open-source platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime used to develop fast and scalable applications quickly with an event-driven, non-blocking input/output architecture. \n\nHowever, these attributes can be inconvenient because verifying the correctness of an application with asynchronous nested callbacks is complex. So, it’s important to watch executing Node.js systems closely. Monitoring your Node.js applications ensures optimal performance, allows the maximization of system availability, and ensures that a system’s health is well maintained.\n\n### What should you look for in a Node.js dashboard? \n\nA [reliable Node.js network monitor](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-nodejs/) must provide enough information to identify the problem sources. Some crucial information includes process ID, log management, request rate, application availability, resource usage, uptime, downtime, system health, error rates and handling, number of connections, load average, and latency. \n\n### What’s included in the Node.js quickstart?\n\nInstall this quickstart to install preconfigured observability solutions: \n- Multiple high-value alerts, including Apdex score and CPU utilization\n- Informative dashboards (Slowest transactions, throughput comparisons, and more)\n\n### The value of New Relic’s Node.js quickstart\n\nOur tool also provides other essential productivity and efficiency-enhancing innovations. Service Maps acquaints developers with their system's architecture providing vital insights to identify issues quickly. Error Analytics granularly pinpoints offending lines of code, relieving developers of a potentially arduous task so that they can concentrate on resolving issues. Our solution offers historical data that could prove essential in process improvement in addition to real-time information.",

    "description": "Lacework is a comprehensive cloud security platform. We aim to turn security into a data problem and replace the frictionful processes for things like breach investigations or achieving compliance standards with simple, contextualized workflows.\nTechnically, our approach is that we replace the traditional 'rules' based mentality that requires you to predict attacker patterns ahead of time with a fully ML based approach.  We baseline what normal user, application and network behaviors look like across your workloads and cloud accounts automatically and then only alert you to deviations from the norm.  This significantly reduces the amount of toil in setting up and maintaining our solution, but also drastically improves the efficacy and amount of security alerts you will receive.\nThe following Quickstart brings the curated security alerts for misconfigurations and anomalous security behaviors into the New Relic platform so you can easily triage against your wealth of observability data or easily transition from monitoring to security investigations from a single interface!\nIf you encounter any issues, have feedback or would like more details on how to get started, please head over to support.lacework.com or send an email to adam.larson@lacework.net!",

    "description": "Speedscale lets you capture traffic from one environment and replay elsewhere. Use the traffic replay to validate new code performance and functionality. Track the SRE golden signals of latency, throughput, CPU, memory and error metrics before you deploy. Preview your container or API behavior in your CI pipeline without having to write any scripts. Any necessary backends are provided by Speedscale’s mocking technology, which also uses past traffic to generate proper responses you expect during traffic replay. \n\nSpeedscale Snapshots are subsets of traffic that you would like to replay to test how your new code reacts, similar to test scenarios. Deploying this quickstart adds a Speedscale dashboard to your New Relic account that includes replay success rates, response time and deep links to reports.\n\nRead the integration tutorial for the Speedscale quickstart on [New Relic Explorer Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/how-to-integrate-with-speedscale/171099).\n\nIf you have questions about this quickstart please contact support@speedscale.com.",

    "description": "## Why port monitoring?\n\nA port is a point where network connections start and end. It is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or service. The New Relic port monitoring quickstart empowers you to monitor the status of networking ports such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).\n\n### Port quickstart highlights\n\nThe New Relic port monitoring quickstart has the following features:\nDashboards: Our dashboards effectively track metrics like total ports open, latest port connected, samples/port, open ports’ timeseries, and open ports by host.\nDetailed installation, configuration, and changelog details in [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-port-monitor).\n\n### New Relic + port = Optimum performance monitoring\n\n[New Relic on-host integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/port-monitoring-integration/) for port monitoring tracks the up and down status of a network port like TCP, UDP, etc. It then reports the data for you to identify issues and solve them quickly. The dashboards provide interactive visualizations to explore your data and understand context. In particular, the dashboard offers you the ability to drill down into performance details  like the total number of open ports or identify the latest port connected.\nThe port instant observability quickstart provides the necessary insights to make your port troubleshooting easier and more efficient. To use our port monitoring integration, you need to install the [New Relic infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux/). You’ll also need to configure the port-monitor-config.yml.sample file.\nDownload the New Relic port quickstart today to monitor your port’s key performance indicators and address issues efficiently. It’s the fastest path to a seamless network port or switch port monitoring.",

Between dealing with incoming and outgoing HTTP requests, interfacing with other APIs and backends, the nuances of the server-side code itself, and any sort of distributed interaction or job scheduling, there are many things that can go wrong. When you monitor your Fubumvc instance, it’s much easier to spot these errors before they occur. FubuMVC fails, your whole application will too. New Relic makes it easier to prevent that failure.\nFor example, if you get an  alert when your transaction errors hit a critical a threshold, it can give you advance notice about a dead server, a network bottleneck, or an attack against your web app. Similarly, the CPU utilization dashboard helps you to know when your server load is high and when traffic might be about to overwhelm a particular HTTP service. You can address your issues proactively, before they cause an outage.",

Observe key metrics like CPU usage, memory, and consumer lag at a glance in a Kafka dashboard. \n\n### Why monitoring kafka is so important\n\nApache Kafka is a fault-tolerant, scalable messaging system used to build real-time data pipelines. Kafka also supports replications natively, and you can build streaming applications that run inside production environments.\n\nLeveraging a Kafka monitoring tool to monitor data replication, retention, and issues like consumer lag is important. New Relic’s Kafka quickstart lets you look at performance metrics and inventory data, create your own custom charts and queries, and create alert policies. \n\n### New Relic Kafka quickstart features\n\n[New Relic’s Kafka monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kafka-monitoring-integration/) tracks space and time retention, leverages replication alerts to uncover potential issues, and uses queries and a Kafka dashboard to explore them.\n\n### New Relic + Kafka quickstart \n\nNew Relic’s performance monitoring provides instant observability out-of-the-box. This quickstart includes:\n\n- Monitoring Kafka topics\n- Dashboards tracking brokers, messages per sec, broker bytes in and out per sec, consumer lag, and more\n- Monitoring of producers and consumers coded in Java\n\n### New Relic - complete Kafka monitoring\n\nProvide total visibility into key performance metrics like the number of client requests and bytes served per second with New Relic’s Kafka monitoring and also track inventory data and metadata in real-time.\n\nOne of the key features of New Relic’s Kafka monitoring is that you can configure your retention settings by time and by space and set up real-time alerts. \nTrack key metrics like gauge, count, and summary as well with New Relic’s instant observability quickstart. Ensure that your infrastructure remains robust and running while averting potential data loss by monitoring Kafka brokers and Kafka producers.",

It targets the AMQP RabbitMQ distribution that integrates with Node.js.\n\n### RabbitMQ quickstart highlights\n\nThe New Relic RabbitMQ quickstart automatically instruments your RabbitMQ application, and comes pre-built dashboards visualizing:\n- Total Used File Descriptors by Node\n- Total Memory Usage by Node\n- Consumers by Queue\n- Consumer Message Utilization by Queue\n- Total Messages by Queue\n- Total Message Throughput by Queue\n- Published Messages by Queue\n- Published Messages Throughput by Queue\n\n### New Relic + RabbitMQ - Your tool for better monitoring\n\n[Monitor RabbitMQ](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/rabbitmq-monitoring-integration/) to ensure it’s coordinating messages between producer and consumer apps in a timely and efficient manner. Silent failures are common in RabbitMQ, frequently causing messages to hang or never be delivered. \n\nThis can drastically warp the downstream behavior of an app. By monitoring RabbitMQ application health, system administrators can catch these errors before they occur.\n\nThe key metrics to keep an eye on include memory usage, message throughput and utilization by queue, and queue consumers. Monitoring memory usage allows for detection of system overloads. Similarly, throughput and utilization trade off on queue capacity. \n\nQueues that are underutilized can be identified for message acceptance, and queues with low throughput can be investigated for hanging messages. Finally, insight into queue consumers can help to evenly distribute them across available queues.",

The framework enables the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It takes away the hassle of web development from developers, and empowers them to focus on writing apps without reinventing the wheel.\n\n### New Relic Django quickstart features\n\nThe New Relic Django monitoring quickstart has the following features:\n- Dashboard: Our standard dashboard provides a clear overview of transactions and errors. The dashboards also help you track other key indicators like daily transaction errors, comparison between weekly transaction errors, memory heap used, most popular transactions, and more.\n- Alerts: You can get instant alerts on performance metrics like Apdex score, CPU utilization, and transaction error.\n\n### Why monitor Django with New Relic?\n\nProactively monitor Django with [New Relic’s Python agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-python/). With an interactive dashboard, you can explore, query, and visualize your data. The quickstart also has three alerts that can detect changes in key metrics:\n- The transaction error alert is triggered when transactions fail more than 10% of the time during a 5-minute period.\n- The high CPU utilization alert is triggered when the CPU utilization is above 90%.\n- Similarly, the Apdex score alert is triggered when the Apdex score is below 0.5 during a period of 5 minutes.\n\nIn addition, the New Relic Django integration can automatically add [browser monitoring](https://newrelic.com/products/browser-monitoring) to any HTML page responses for the Django Python web framework. Install the New Relic Django quickstart to instrument Django with New Relic’s Python agent, and track Django’s key metrics in real-time.",

New Relic Curb quickstart automatically instruments Curb with the [New Relic Ruby agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/), thereby empowering you to monitor Curb via interactive dashboards and instant alerts.\n\n### Curb quickstart highlights\n\nThe New Relic Curb quickstart has the following features:\nDashboards: Our dashboards provide you a clear overview of transactions, errors, and the virtual machine. The dashboards also help you monitor other key indicators like top 5 slowest transactions, latest errors, and more.\nAlerts: You can get instant alerts on performance metrics like Apdex score, memory usage, transaction errors, and CPU utilization.\n\n### New Relic + Curb = Optimum performance monitoring\n\nMonitor Curb with New Relic’s Ruby agent. With an interactive dashboard, you can explore, query, and visualize your data. This helps you to identify issues faster and improve Curb’s performance. The quickstart also has four alerts that can detect changes in key metrics. You can integrate the alerts with your favorite tools such as Slack or PagerDuty, and you will get instant notification when there is any issue.\nYou can [configure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/) the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. The Ruby agent supports Curb version 0.8.1 or higher. \nInstall the New Relic Curb observability quickstart today to track Curb’s metrics in real time through a seamless dashboard and different alerts. The quickstart empowers you to leverage our Ruby agent for instant and comprehensive monitoring of Curb.\n",

    "description": "## Prometheus monitoring \n\nPrometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. Setting up Prometheus is straightforward, but scaling up and managing is not. That’s where New Relic steps in.\n\n### New Relic's Prometheus quickstart\n\nNew Relic offers two Prometheus integration schemes, Remote Write and OpenMetrics. \n\n[Remote Write](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/prometheus-remote-write-integration/) is ideal for well-established Prometheus infrastructures. It provides easy access to your metrics and only takes one line of yaml in your configuration for access. \n\n[OpenMetrics](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-openmetrics/configure-prometheus-openmetrics-integrations/) allows for more visibility across multiple container platforms. Once the integration is set up, you can query data on memory usage for pods in deployment, facet any metrics, and view raw metric values all in one place.\n\nNew Relic's Prometheus Integration stores various kinds of telemetry data - whether open-source, vendor-specific, or vendor-agnostic. \n\n### Value of the Prometheus quickstart \n\nThis New Relic quickstart helps you to configure Prometheus Remote Write.\n\n#### Remote Write:\n\nSee all of your metrics in one place\n- Combine and group all data across an entire software stack\n- Connect Grafana dashboards\n- Better understand the relationship between data and behaviors related to your software stack",

However, in some cases, NGINX may not serve requests as quickly as expected due to problems in an application or architecture. Monitoring NGINX performance is essential to ensure that your web application and server environment are healthy. The key to effective NGINX monitoring is the New Relic NGINX quickstart.\n\n### New Relic Nginx quickstart features\n\n- Dashboards: NGINX dashboards proactively monitor NGINX metrics like requests per second, active connections, connections accepted per second, connections dropped per second, etc.\n- Automatic On-host integrations instrumentation\n- Compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus\n\n### New Relic - the complete Nginx performance monitoring tool\n\n[Monitor key NGINX with the New Relic NGINX Performance monitoring integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/nginx-monitoring-integration/) with metrics like requests per second, connections accepted per second, connections dropped per second, etc. Specifically, our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to the New Relic platform, where you can see valuable insights. From that platform, you can also query data, understand integration data in detail, and create alert conditions.\n\nIn addition, the integration provides useful aggregates of detailed error reports for HTTP error responses. This gives you early warnings of missing pages or code errors and exceptions. With the New Relic NGINX integration, you can monitor NGINX running on an Ubuntu server or running as a service in Kubernetes or on Amazon ECS. The tool is compatible with both the open-source and commercial versions of NGINX.\n\nDownload the New Relic NGINX quickstart today to improve NGINX response time, execute NGINX performance tuning, and monitor NGINX traffic efficiently! It is the key to a healthy NGINX server that provides a seamless user experience for web applications.",

    "description": "## What is Azure Virtual Network?\nAzure Virtual Network (VNet) provides the means for Azure cloud resources such as virtual machines to securely communicate with each other as well as the rest of the internet and on-premises resources. Using VNet to create a private network gives you control over network filtering, routing, and other key pieces of the network infrastructure. \nGiven an Azure virtual network, you can do things like assign a public IP, assign a load balancer, and handle outbound connections. VNets are ideal for developers deploying on Azure resources who want fine-grained control over network management.\n\n### New Relic Azure Vnet integration\nNew Relic's integration for Azure Virtual Network reports metric data about your virtual networks (VNets), like packets dropped per second or bytes forwarded per second. It also collects data about the status and configuration of your account. The selection of dashboards include:\n- Total virtual networks: The total number of virtual networks currently live\n- Virtual networks time series: Displays the fluctuation of the total number of virtual networks over a series of timepoints\n- Virtual network per region: Displays the virtual networks within a specific geographic region\n- Public IPs under DDoS attack: Quickly identify which IPs on the network may be experiencing a DDOS attack\n- Virtual network per resource group: Shows the number of virtual networks deployed within each resource group\n\n### Why monitor Azure Virtual Network with New Relic?\nHaving insight into Azure virtual network performance is key to keeping network systems healthy and reliable. Virtual networks are often vulnerable to attack, so continuous monitoring of IP requests and understanding which IPs may be experiencing a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack can be critical for initiating a proactive response. \nThe virtual network time series display can give insight into fluctuations in network health and uptime within a specified interval and can be useful for drilling down into any deviations from the norm.\nFinally, being able to understand how virtual networks are distributed across geographic regions can help you pinpoint when a particular region is being underserved and deploy network resources accordingly.",
